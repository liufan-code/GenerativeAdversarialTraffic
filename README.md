# GenerativeAdversarialTraffic
This repository houses the developments and implementations related to the Generative Adversarial Traffic Sample Technique. This technique deceives machine learning models, preventing accurate identification of anonymous traffic and resisting man-in-the-middle attacks, specifically tested against DNN and LSTM models, achieving a 90% obfuscation success rate.

## Features
- Generation of adversarial traffic samples
- Evaluation against DNN and LSTM models
- Scripts for testing obfuscation success rate

## How to Use
Kindly go through the README files in the individual directories for specific usage instructions and details.
